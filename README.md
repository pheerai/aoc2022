# AoC 2022

Contains solutions to [Advent of Code][aoc] 2022, written in Kotlin.

This is not meant to be any example-code, and it's not focused on anything, especially not:

* Efficiency (both from runtime and storage consumption perspective)
* Total clarity

Instead, I'll just try to solve each of the problems as intuitively and extensible as possible, in the way that comes to mind, and (sometimes) trying to work with aspects of Kotlin I haven't worked with yet.
